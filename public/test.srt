Title: AITA for not inviting my sister to my wedding?

2
00:00:05,001 --> 00:00:10,000
My sister (28F) and I (26F) have never been close. Growing up,
we had different interests and friends, and we rarely spent time together.

3
00:00:10,001 --> 00:00:15,000
Recently, she did something that really hurt me. She threw a party and
invited everyone in the family except for me.

4
00:00:15,001 --> 00:00:20,000
I only found out about it through social media. When I confronted her,
she said it was a "small gathering" and she "didn't think I'd be interested."

5
00:00:20,001 --> 00:00:25,000
Fast forward to my wedding planning. I decided not to invite her.
I felt that if she didn't want me at her parties, why should I want her at my wedding?

6
00:00:25,001 --> 00:00:30,000
When the invitations went out, my parents were furious. They said I was
being petty and that I should "be the bigger person."

7
00:00:30,001 --> 00:00:35,000
They are now threatening not to come to the wedding if I don't invite her.
I feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place.

8
00:00:35,001 --> 00:00:40,000
On one hand, I don't want her there because of how she's treated me.
On the other hand, I don't want to ruin my relationship with my parents.

9
00:00:40,001 --> 00:00:45,000
So, AITA for not inviting my sister to my wedding?
